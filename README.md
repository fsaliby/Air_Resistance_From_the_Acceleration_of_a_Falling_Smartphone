# Air Resistance From the Acceleration of a Falling Smartphone

This repository contains the data and code used in the study "Air Resistance From the Acceleration of a Falling Smartphone". The study investigates the motion of a falling smartphone under the influence of air drag using acceleration data collected by its built-in accelerometer.

**Important Note on Data Availability:** This repository includes data from 22 Fall experiments and 16 Up-Down experiments (`raw_data.tar.gz`). For Up-Down Trial 1, only the processed data (`clean_data.pkl`) is available (raw data was lost), but this processed dataset was used in the paper's analysis. All other trials contain complete raw data.
